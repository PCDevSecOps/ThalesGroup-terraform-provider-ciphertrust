# CipherTrust Provider

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

[Sample scripts](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/terraform-provider-ciphertrust/tree/main/sample-scripts) allow you to easily create CipherTrust Manager resources for your cloud and includes some practical examples of using the CipherTrust provider with other cloud providers. 

## Supported Clouds

## Public Clouds
- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud

## Thales Devices
The following devices can be used to create keys for the above public clouds.
- DSM
- HSM Luna

## Provider Initialization

All CipherTrust Provider parameters can be provided in :
 - The provider block of the terraform script
 - A configuration file ~/.ciphertrust/config

CipherTrust address and authentication parameters can be provided as environment variables also.

The following table illustrates which parameters can be provided as environment variables or in the configuration file.

| Provider Parameter   | Environment Variable | Config File | Required  | Default Value |
|:---------------------|:---------------------|:------------|:----------|:--------------|
| address              | CM_ADDRESS           | address     | Yes       | N/A           |
| username             | CM_USERNAME          | username    | Yes       | N/A           |
| password             | CM_PASSWORD          | password    | Yes       | N/A           |
| domain               | CM_DOMAIN            | domain      | No        | root          |
| remaining parameters | no                   | yes         | No        | N/A           |

The order of precedence when determining the value of a parameter: 
1. Provider Block
2. Environment Variable
3. Configuration File

## Provider Block 

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {
  address  = "cm-address"
  username = "cm-username"
  password = "cm-password"
  domain   = "cm-domain"
}
```
## Configuration File

All provider parameters can be read from the configuration file.

The configuration file is ~/.ciphertrust/config. 

```terraform
  address = cm-address
  username = cm-username
  password = cm-password
```
If the above values exist in the configuration file the provider block can be:

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {}
 ```

### Environment variables

Some provider parameters can be specified in environment variables.

```bash
export CM_USERNAME=cm-username
export CM_PASSWORD=cm-password
export CM_DOMAIN=cm-domain
```

If the above environment variables exist the provider block can be:

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {}
 ```
