  The CipherTrust provider can be used to manage resources in a CipherTrust Manager instance. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

# CipherTrust Provider

## Supported Clouds

- AWS
- Azure
- DSM
- Google Cloud
- HSM

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {
  address           = "https://34.207.194.87"
  username          = "bob"
  password          = "password"
}
```

### Example Usage with a Configuration File

CipherTrust provider can read provider configuration from ~/.ciphertrust/config.

An example configuration file.

```terraform
  address = https://34.207.194.87
  username = bob
  password = password
```

If a configuration file is used the provider can be initialized with an empty provider block.

```terraform
provider "ciphertrust" {)
```

Configuration items in the provider block have precedence over those in the configuration file.

## Environment Variables for AWS and Azure Clouds

The following environment variables can be used by the CipherTrust provider when creating connections to Azure and AWS.

### AWS

```hcl
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Azure

```hcl
