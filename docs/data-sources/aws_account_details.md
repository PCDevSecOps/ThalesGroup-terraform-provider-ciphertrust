# ciphertrust_aws_account_details (Data Source)

This data-source provides some AWS details associated with a [ciphertrust_aws_connection](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ThalesGroup/ciphertrust/latest/docs/resources/aws_connection) resource.

The details can optionally be used when creating a [ciphertrust_aws_kms](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ThalesGroup/ciphertrust/latest/docs/resources/aws_kms) resource.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an AWS connection
resource "ciphertrust_aws_connection" "aws_connection" {
  name              = "connection-name"
  access_key_id     = "access-key-id"
  secret_access_key = "secret-access-key"
}

data "ciphertrust_aws_account_details" "account_details" {
  aws_connection = ciphertrust_aws_connection.aws_connection.id
}

resource "ciphertrust_aws_kms" "kms" {
  account_id     = data.ciphertrust_aws_account_details.account_details.account_id
  aws_connection = ciphertrust_aws_connection.aws_connection.id
  name           = "kms-name"
  regions        = data.ciphertrust_aws_account_details.account_details.regions
}
