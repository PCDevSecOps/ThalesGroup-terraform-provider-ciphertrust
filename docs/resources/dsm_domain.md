# ciphertrust_dsm_domain (Resource)

This resource specifies the DSM domain in which keys will be created.

Resources of this type can be used as the container when scheduling rotation for:
- [ciphertrust_aws_key](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ThalesGroup/ciphertrust/latest/docs/resources/aws_key) resources
- [ciphertrust_azure_key](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ThalesGroup/ciphertrust/latest/docs/resources/azure_key) resources
- [ciphertrust_gcp_key](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ThalesGroup/ciphertrust/latest/docs/resources/gcp_key) resources

This resource is dependent on a [ciphertrust_dsm_connection](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ThalesGroup/ciphertrust/latest/docs/resources/dsm_connection) resource.

[ciphertrust_dsm_key](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ThalesGroup/ciphertrust/latest/docs/resources/dsm_key) resources are dependent on this resource.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# This resource is dependent on a ciphertrust_dsm_connection resource
resource "ciphertrust_dsm_connection" "dsm_connection" {
  name        = "connection-name"
  nodes {
    hostname    = "host-ip-address"
    certificate = "dsm-server.pem"
  }
  password = "dsm_password"
  username = "dsm_username"
}

# Assign a DSM domain to the connection
resource "ciphertrust_dsm_domain" "dsm_domain" {
  dsm_connection = ciphertrust_dsm_connection.dsm_connection.id
  domain_id      = dsm_domain_id
}

# Create a DSM key
resource "ciphertrust_dsm_key" "dsm_key" {
  name            = "key-name"
  algorithm       = "RSA2048"
  domain          = ciphertrust_dsm_domain.dsm_domain.id
  extractable     = true
  object_type     = "asymmetric"
}
```
