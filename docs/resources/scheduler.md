## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ciphertrust_scheduler" "key_rotation" {
  cckm_key_rotation_params {
    cloud_name = "AzureCloud"
  }
  name       = "rotation_job_name"
  operation  = "cckm_key_rotation"
  run_at     = "0 9 * * sat"
}

resource "ciphertrust_scheduler" "key_synchronization" {
  cckm_synchronization_params {
    cloud_name      = "azure"
    synchronize_all = true
  }
  name       = "sync_job_name"
  operation  = "cckm_synchronization"
  run_at     = "0 9 * * fri"

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) Name of the job configuration.
- **run_at** (String) Described using the cron expression format: '* * * * * 'These five values indicate when the job should be executed. They are in order of minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week. Valid values are 0-59 (minutes), 0-23 (hours), 1-31 (day of month), 1-12 or jan-dec (month), and 0-6 or sun-sat (day of week). Names are case-insensitive. For example, To run on Saturday at 23:45(11:45 PM): '45 23 * * 6' or '45 23 * * sat' To run on the first of the month at 09:00: '0 9 1 * *'

### Optional

- **cckm_key_rotation_params** (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cckm_key_rotation_params))
- **cckm_synchronization_params** (Block List, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cckm_synchronization_params))
- **description** (String) Description of the job configuration.
- **disabled** (Boolean) Disable the job configuration. Defaults to false.
- **end_date** (String) Date the job configuration becomes inactive. RFC3339 format, for example, 2021-07-03T14:24Z.
- **operation** (String) Type of operation. Currently, only cckm_key_rotation and cckm_synchronization are supported. Default is cckm_key_rotation.
- **run_on** (String) Use 'any' to run the rotation job on any node in the cluster. Use a specific node ID to run the rotation job on that node. Default is 'any'.
- **start_date** (String) Date the job configuration becomes active. RFC3339 format, for example, 2021-07-03T14:24:00Z.

### Nested Schema for `cckm_key_rotation_params`

Required:

- **cloud_name** (String) Name of the cloud where rotation operation will be triggered. Options are: aws, AzureCloud and gcp.

Optional:

- **aws_retain_alias** (Boolean) Retain the alias and timestamp on the archived key after rotation.
- **expiration** (String) Expiration time of the new key. If not specified, the new key material never expires. For example, if you want the scheduler to the rotate keys that are expiring within six hours of its run, set expire_in to 6h. Use either 'Xd' for x days or 'Yh' for y hours.
- **expire_in** (String) Period during which certain keys are going to expire. The scheduler rotates the keys that are expiring in this period. If not specified, the scheduler rotates all the keys. For example, if you want the scheduler to rotate the keys that are expiring within six hours of its run, set expire_in to 6h. Use either 'Xd' for x days or 'Yh' for y hours.
