# ciphertrust_domain (Resource)

Domains isolate resources like keys to a single domain and cannot be accessed across domains. Every system has a root domain by default. Additional child domains can be created.

When a domain is created an administrator can define which system users are administrators of that domain. Domain administrators can explicitly add or remove system users to / from the domain or create group maps to implicitly include system users in the domain.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ciphertrust_domain" "cm_domain" {
  name = "domain_test"
  admins = ["admin"]
  allow_user_management = false
  meta_data = {
      "abc":"xyz"
  }
}
```
